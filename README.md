# The Odin Project Landing Page
This is my langing page assignment for The Odin Project.

## Why Am I Creating a Random Landing Page?
I am creating a landing page because it serves as a foundation for building a website. It allows me to focus on creating a specific layout and design, without the added complexity of multiple pages and navigation. 

By creating a landing page, I am able to develop important skills such as using HTML for structure and CSS for styling, as well as understanding the principles of design and user experience. This will help me to create more effective and user-friendly websites in the future.

## Goals:
- [x] Create Basic Layout
- [x] Create Basic Style
- [ ] Optimize for Mobile, Tablets & Desktop Simultaneously
